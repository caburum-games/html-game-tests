## File Descriptions
<h3><a href="https://ccreativecnd.github.io/html/flappy-block.html">Flappy Block</a></h3>
This is a spin-off of Flappy Bird. To play, hold the "JUMP" button to move up. If you touch the green lines, the game is over. You need to press "RESET" for a new game. This game was coded in HTML5 using the `<canvas>` element.
<h3><a href="https://ccreativecnd.github.io/html/snake.html">Snake</a></h3>
Use WASD or the arrow keys to move. Collect the red circles to grow longer. You can touch yourself, but if you touch the sides you die. You can see your score in the bottom left corner.
