<h3><a href="https://ccreativecnd.github.io/html/flappy-block.html">Flappy Block</a></h3>
This is a spin-off of Flappy Bird. To play, hold the "JUMP" button to move up. If you touch the green lines, the game is over. You need to press "RESET" for a new game. This game was coded in HTML5 using the `<canvas>` element.
